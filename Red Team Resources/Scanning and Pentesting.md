# Scanning & Pentesting Tools

Tools and platforms used for **vulnerability scanning, penetration testing,
network discovery, fuzzing, DFIR, and cloud security assessments**.

---

## Vulnerability Scanning & Exploitation Frameworks

- **OpenVAS** – A comprehensive vulnerability scanning and management framework.
- **Metasploit Framework** – Platform for developing and executing exploits against remote targets, including payloads, shellcode, and exploit modules.

---

## Security-Focused Operating Systems

- **Kali Linux** – Debian-based distribution designed for penetration testing and digital forensics. Includes tools like Nmap, Wireshark, John the Ripper, and Aircrack-ng.
- **Tsurugi Linux** – Customized Linux distribution for DFIR, malware analysis, and OSINT, based on Ubuntu 20.04 (64-bit) with a custom 5.15.12 kernel.

## Network Scanning & Enumeration

- **Nmap** – Open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing.
- **RustScan** – High-speed port scanner written in Rust, often used as a faster frontend to Nmap.
- **Amass** – Advanced DNS enumeration tool using scraping, brute forcing, web archives, and reverse DNS techniques.
- **Sublist3r** – Fast subdomain enumeration tool for penetration testers.
- **Legion** – Semi-automated network penetration testing framework for discovery and reconnaissance.
- **Netz** – Tool for discovering internet-wide misconfigurations using zgrab2 and related technologies.

---

## Packet Crafting & Traffic Generation

- **pig** – Linux-based packet crafting tool.
- **Scapy** – Python-based interactive packet manipulation library and framework.
- **Anevicon** – High-performance UDP-based load generator written in Rust.
- **Finshir** – Coroutines-driven low-and-slow traffic generator written in Rust.

---

## Fuzzing & Web Testing

- **Boofuzz** – Network protocol fuzzing engine and fuzz testing framework.
- **monsoon** – Flexible and fast interactive HTTP enumeration and fuzzing tool.

---

## Exploit Discovery & Automation

- **Pompem** – Open-source Python tool that automates exploit searches across multiple databases such as Exploit-DB, 1337day, and Packetstorm Security.

---

## Cloud, Container & Runtime Security

- **Deepfence ThreatMapper** – Apache v2 licensed runtime vulnerability scanner for Kubernetes, virtual machines, and serverless environments.
- **Deepfence SecretScanner** – Tool for identifying secrets and credentials in container images and file systems.
- **Cognito Scanner** – CLI tool for pentesting AWS Cognito instances, supporting attacks like unwanted account creation, account oracle, and identity pool escalation.
